# CuisineBot
by David Valero Masachs.

## Problem Statement
One of the most advanced pieces of software is represented by conversational AIs. With a long-standing fasciation for machine dialogue and clear convenience brought to the table, conversational AIs have become increasingly popular. With modern day software, in fact, they are a hot commodity. 
A key feature of these conversational AIs is task-oriented dialogue: A feature that lets the user place orders or make reservations through speech.
Thus, the need for domain-specific chatbots arises: a series of task-focused chat bots that is able to interact with users through human-like speech that help them with completing tasks like reservations or order placements.


## Set-up Steps
Requirements: Python 3.7 (3.8 and beyond not supported as of now for re-training due to current spacy limitations)

1. Clone this repository
   
2. In a terminal run:
```
py cuisineBot.py
```

3. A new window will appear to interact with the chatbot.
